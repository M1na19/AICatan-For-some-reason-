Step 1: Install Flask
Make sure you have Flask installed on your machine. You can use pip, the package installer for Python, to install Flask. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

pip install flask

Step 2: Create a Flask Application
Create a new Python file, for example, app.py, and open it in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). Import the necessary Flask modules and create a Flask application instance:

python

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

Step 3: Define Routes and Functions
Define the routes of your application and the corresponding functions that will be executed when those routes are accessed. Routes are defined using the @app.route decorator. Here's an example of a simple route:

python

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, World!'

Step 4: Run the Application
At the end of your app.py file, add the following code to run the Flask application:

python

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

Step 5: Start the Server
Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where your app.py file is located, and run the following command:

python app.py

The Flask development server will start running, and you should see output indicating that the server is running on a specific address, usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/.

Step 6: Access Your Flask Application
Open a web browser and enter the address http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/. You should see the response from your Flask application, which in the example above would be "Hello, World!".
